 * Welcome to my website! As an HR Process Engineer, I specialize in streamlining HR operations to reduce costs, 
 * improve efficiency, and enhance the overall employee experience. By applying process improvement methodologies 
 * such as Lean, Six Sigma, and Agile, I optimize HR functions such as recruitment, onboarding, performance management,
 * and employee relations. I also provide consulting services to help organizations optimize their business  processes.
 * 
 * As a hobby, I enjoy full stack web development, and have experience in various programming languages.
 *
 * The main purpose of this website is to showcase my skills and experiences in a fun and interactive way.
 * While demonstrating how HTML, Markdown, and CSS work together, I hope you enjoy the experience.
 *
 *
 * What's a better way to get to know me than to see my work?
 *  
 *    **** How about a little live coding? ****
